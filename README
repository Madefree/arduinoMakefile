Modified Makefile to build Arduino sketches from Fox Board

This makefile allows you to build sketches from the command line
without the Arduino environment (or Java).


Detailed instructions for using the makefile:

1. Copy this file into the folder with your sketch. There should be a
   file with the same name as the folder and with the extension .pde
   (e.g. foo.pde in the foo/ folder).

2. Below, modify the line containing "TARGET" to refer to the name of
   of your program's file without an extension (e.g. TARGET = foo).

3. Modify the line containg "ARDUINO" to point the directory that
   contains the Arduino core.

4. Modify the line containing "PORT" to refer to the filename
   representing the USB or serial connection to your Arduino board
   (e.g. PORT = /dev/tty.USB0).  If the exact name of this file
   changes, you can use * as a wildcard (e.g. PORT = /dev/tty.USB*).

5. At the command line, change to the directory containing your
   program's file and the makefile.

6. Type "make" and press enter to compile/verify your program.

7. Type "make upload", reset your Arduino board, and press enter  to
   upload your program to the Arduino board.
